# Assignment 1 - Project Design

## Description

Each section taking this class will find their own project. The first assignment
focuses on finding suitable projects for you and your fellow students to tackle.
Eric Ries defines a startup as “a human institution designed to deliver a new
product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty”. This suggests that
whenever we have an initial idea we should focus on reducing the uncertainty
surrounding that idea. To that end, you need propose and verify an idea without
writing any code.

Your suggested project needs to satisfy the following constraints:
 - The project needs to be achievable (can 10-15 programmers working part-time build it in 15 weeks?)
 - The project needs to solve a concrete need, and this need has been validated through a short experiment which you've carried out.
 - The project must be solvable using code. (Ideally the code will be in Python, and will take the form of a webservice, but those are not absolute requirements.)

This assignment requires a clear description of:
    - the problem that needs solving
    - who will benefit from this project (the “customer”, though it need not be commercial)
    - the short experiment that you’ve already carried out in order to validate that your proposed customer does in fact need this problem solved (**no code need be written for this assignment**).

You need to hand in a short pdf report (no more than 1000 words) in which you make as strong a case as possible for your project being the most worthwhile for this class to pursue.

## Focused Outcomes Added

**#cs162-agile**: Follow the agile movement when researching and developing a new product. This involves finding short feedback loops throughout all stages of the product lifecycle (inception, development, and deployment).
