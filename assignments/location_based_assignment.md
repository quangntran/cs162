# LBA - Final project user interview:
## Description

Now that your final project has been defined, you will need to communicate
regularly with the potential users of your system to ensure that a useful
product is built!

For this location-based assignment, you will need to find a potential user of
your system in your city, and conduct an in-depth interview with them. If this
is happening early in the development cycle then the point of this interview
will be to make sure that the system as currently designed will be useful to
them. Later in the semester then you should have a simple demo, and make sure
that the user understands the system and is able to access all the basic
functionality.

Talking to your user is the best way of validating your design, and testing any
assumptions that you might have about your project. Be sure to prepare
beforehand with a few questions around:
 - identifying when the user would use your system
 - the typical tasks that a user expects to be able to accomplish with your system
 - the user flows that a user expects for each task
It will be in your best interest to coordinate amongst your team and ensure that
these user interviews occur periodically throughout the semester to ensure that
there is regular and consistent feedback to guide the final project.

### Assignment instructions:
 - There will typically be more students than weeks available for this assignment. You are encouraged (but not required) to conduct the interview in pairs where possible, and you can also submit the writeup together.
 - Clearly provide the details of where and when the user interview was conducted.
 - If the user interacts with a demo, then please refrain from telling the user exactly which buttons to press. The insight on where a user gets stuck is probably the most useful feedback of all!
 - Submit a pdf clearly detailing all the questions you posed to the user, all the answers that the user gave, and highlight how talking to the user helped improve the system, or where you were able to correct small miscommunications from previous interviews.
 - Your pdf must also be shared with the rest of the group as soon as itâ€™s been written up to ensure that everyone knows and understands the user feedback.

## Focused Outcomes Added

- **#cs162-communication**: Ensure that all code, documentation and commit messages are clearly written with explanations where appropriate.
- **#cs162-agile**: Follow the agile movement when researching and developing a new product. This involves finding short feedback loops throughout all stages of the product lifecycle (inception, development, and deployment).
