# Final project:
## Description

The final project for CS162 will consist of the entire section implementing a
project chosen from the suggestions given in assignment 1. Your instructor will
provide more specific details of the project.

A section consisting of 15+ students is far too big a team to successfully
manage so the final project must be decomposable into several smaller systems
with students being able to form groups and work on the the smaller systems
somewhat independently.

The final project is introduced early in the course, and students are encouraged
to start working early as well. It is possible (and even encouraged) that you
try finish the project early in the semester and free up significant time for
other courses.

### Grading:
Everything will be managed from a github repo, and this will allow the tracking
of individual contributions to the project.
A significant portion of your grade (25% - 40%) will also depend on whether or
not there was successful collaboration within the project which led to a useful
product. So if there are issues that fall awkwardly between two teams then it is
in the interests of both teams to get the issue fixed!

There is also scope for specialized positions within the project. For example,
someone may nominate themselves as a project manager (subject to the approval of
the rest of the section). The project manager would ensure that all teams are
making progress and coordinate the implementation of any features which span
multiple teams. Depending on the project, it might make sense for specialized QA
positions as well, but this should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with
your instructor.

### Arbitration:
Group work can have many failure modes, and the probability of these failure
modes tends to increase with the size of the group. To this end, students are
encouraged to be proactive in ensuring that there is a harmonious and
collaborative working environment. This experience is meant to closely simulate
a professional working environment, so please remember to remain professional!

If a collaborative working environment is not possible, please approach your
instructor who shall have the final say on how to proceed. In extreme cases, the
instructor will be able to approve the transferral of work away from obstructive
students which will result in that student receiving a lower grade.

### Submission:
Please submit a pdf containing URLs for several pull requests that you have
authored for this project. Each pull request should be a complete feature, with
docstrings and tests. Extensive documentation is also permissible as a gradable
pull request. Each pull request should have been successfully reviewed by at
least one other member of your team. There should be sufficient description in
the pull request comments for one to understand the feature is that is being
added.

## Focused Outcomes Added

- **#algorithms**: Apply algorithmic thinking strategies to solve problems and effectively implement working code. (C) FA
- **#breakitdown**: Organize problems into tractable components and design solutions. (H) EA
- **#cs162-communication**: Ensure that all code, documentation and commit messages are clearly written with explanations where appropriate.
- **#cs162-abstraction**: Design interfaces (class interfaces, user interfaces, etc.) that are easy to use and hide much of the complexity needed for the implementation.
- **#cs162-separationofconcerns**: Design systems such that any task is handled by exactly one component and each component handles conceptually similar tasks.
- **#cs162-testing**: Write comprehensive and meaningful testing code for the system.
