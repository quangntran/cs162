## An HTML Primer

The next few sessions will focus on web technologies.

The following (freely-available) short course uses active learning to help you
understand HTML:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML

It consists of the following guides:
1. Getting started with HTML
2. Metadata in HTML
3. HTML text fundamentals
4. Creating hyperlinks
5. Advanced text formatting
6. Document and website structure
7. Debugging HTML

Work through the guides at your own pace.  If you are comfortable with the
material then you can skip any sections as you see fit.

## Questions

### 1. Work through the exercise in debugging HTML
The final guide in the course involves [debugging some badly written html]
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Debugging_HTML).

Work through the tutorial and fix all the bugs you can find.

It is always good practice to submit your HTML to an online validation service
which can highlight any issues there might be.  Make sure that your final
solution [validates](https://validator.w3.org/) successfully.

Be sure to bring the valid HTML to class and be able to paste it in as a poll
response.

### 2. Kanban board

A Kanban board is a simple form of task management.  Every task that you add
can be in one of three states:

1. To do
2. Doing
3. Done

Please find a few example Kanban board websites and play around with it so that
you have a clear idea of the typical layout of a Kanban board.

Now design a simple static html webpage as a mockup of your own Kanban website.
It is not necessary to include graphics, but could be a nice
If you want to make your website look beautiful, then you should also read up on
[CSS styling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS).  
An example of using CSS to create a 3 column layout is given
[here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_three_columns.asp),
with an alternative approach gven [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_multiple_columns.asp).

*For now you do not need to have any forms on your website,, as we will cover
HTML forms in the next session.*

Make sure that your final solution [validates](https://validator.w3.org/)
successfully. Be sure to bring screenshots of your final design, along with the
valid HTML, to class.

(Note that this Kanban board will be developed further in later sessions and
eventually submitted as an assignment.)
