# CS162 - Software Engineering

Students are free to suggest modifications to this code by cloning, modifying and submitting a pull request.  It is suggested that students initially sketch out the modification and confirm with the course instructor that it is a suitable modification.  Open an issue, as part of the suggestion.  If the course instructor agrees then go ahead and create the entire modification (as a pull request). Once merged, then the student will be eligible for a 4 on the most relevant LO for the next assignment.  If 3 such modifications are accepted then the scores may be combined into a single 5 (at the students discretion).  Modifications must be either substantive explanations, or else significant reworking/creation of class exercises.

Currently, the topic that needs documentation the most is for the initial setup.  Hint hint!  This would entail: a nice description of how to get a github account, how to install the latest version of python 3, how to pull this repo, and how to suggest changes to the repo.

Some of these directories will not align with the most recent version of the syllabus.  In all such cases the syllabus should be viewed as the authoritative source of information and you are encouraged to inform your instructor of the discrepancy.
