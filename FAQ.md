## Setting up Python 3

**Q: How do I know if Python 3 is already installed on my device?**

**A:** Open up Terminal (on Mac) or CMD / Powershell (on Windows) and type `python --version` into the window. The response will either show the default version of Python installed on your device or let you know that the command `python` is not recognized because there is no version installed. If the default version is Python 2, then type `python3 --version` to check if Python 3 is installed. 

**Q: How do I set up Python 3?**

**A:** You can go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install the latest version.

**Q: How do I install a Python editor?**

**A:** Some recommended Python editors are Atom (Mac only), Sublime, and PyCharm. You can download and install Sublime from [this link](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and PyCharm from [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). For Atom, download it from [here](https://atom.io) and follow [this guide](https://medium.com/@andrealmar/how-to-setup-atom-as-your-python-development-environment-a67fe8738bd3) to set up Atom as a Python development environment (optional).
